Pluggable database creation, deletion and Oracle Enterprise Manager

# Overview
This assignment demonstrates practical implementation of Oracle Database multitenant architecture, focusing on Pluggable Database (PDB) management and web-based database administration using Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Express.
# Tasks Completed
1. Pluggable Database Creation: Created and configured new PDBs using multiple methods

3. PDB Management: Performed lifecycle operations including opening, closing, and switching between containers
4. PDB Deletion: Safely removed PDBs using proper procedures
5. Oracle Enterprise Manager Configuration: Configured and accessed EM Express for web-based database administration
6. Documentation: Compiled comprehensive technical report with commands, screenshots, and best practices


# Explanation of Each Task
# Task 1: Pluggable Database Creation
Objective: Create new Pluggable Databases using different methods to understand PDB architecture and provisioning.

# Task 2: PDB Management Operations
Objective: Perform common PDB lifecycle management operations. But mainly remove Pluggable Databases using proper procedures.
# Task 3: Oracle Enterprise Manager Configuration
Objective: Configure and access Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Express for web-based database administration.
